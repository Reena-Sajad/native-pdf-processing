# native-pdf-processing
This project builds a full NLP pipeline that extracts text from a PDF, preprocesses it (cleaning, tokenization, spell correction, etc.), and performs both binary and multi-class classification using BERT embeddings and a stacking ensemble model. It includes detailed evaluation with ROC curves, confusion matrices, and performance metrics.
